# Smog Detector

It is a project from machine lerning field - an implementation of kNN algorithm and random forest. The purpose of this project is to detect smog class based on weather condition (classification problem). Also achived results are included in report. 
Application is partially developed in C# and partially in Python. 
Weather data were synced form IMGW.

More information can be found in documentation folder.

## Purpose

This project was developed during one of my courses at the University. It was a group project and it allowed me to get base understaing of machine lerning - classification, regression.

## Licence

This project is under the MIT License.
